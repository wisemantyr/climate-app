## Excercise Description

<i> Use the provided hawaii.sqlite files to complete your climate analysis and data exploration.
  - Choose a start date and end date for your trip. Make sure that your vacation range is approximately 3-15 days total.
  - Use SQLAlchemy create_engine to connect to your sqlite database.
  - Use SQLAlchemy automap_base() to reflect your tables into classes and save a reference to those classes called Station and Measurement.
  - Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.
  - Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.
  - Sort the DataFrame values by date and plot the results.

Now that you have completed your initial analysis, design a Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed. </i>
